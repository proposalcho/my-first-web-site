  <p>Cocktails and Mocktails are mixed drinks that have become popular since the first quarter of the twentieth century and all the bars offer  a list of selected cocktails and mocktails.</p>
  <p>The word “Cocktail” was first described in an American magazine as a mixture of spirits, sugar, water, and bitters in 1806.</p>
  <p>One of many popular notions on the birth of the word cocktail is that during the American War of Independence, in 1779, an innkeeper, Betsy Flanagan of Virginia prepared a meal of chicken she stole from a neighbor who was pro-British. She then served the French soldiers the mixed drinks decorated with the feathers from the birds.</p>
