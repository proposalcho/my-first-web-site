  <img src="blend.jpg" width="500">
  <p>The blending method of mixing a cocktail is used for combining fruits, solid foods, ice, etc. in an electric blender. Any drink that can be shaken may be made by blending as well.</p>
  <p>It is a suitable method for making a large number of mixed drinks but it consumes more time. If the fruit is pureed for the drink, the ice should be added after pureeing the fruit, according to its consistency. If too much ice will be added in the beginning, the drink may be diluted.</p>
